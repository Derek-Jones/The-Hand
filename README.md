Build a working Adams family hand

Two servos are used to simulate a finger.  The action is pull (rotate down) forward with short segment, lift up with long segment, straighten short segment, drop long segment to neutral positon, repeat.

Everything is controlled by an Intel Edison board.

Two fingers are enough to give x-y movement

To stop The Hand rotating on the spot (out version 1) a pair of forward pulling fingers are needed (version 2).

A video (thanks to Sidd) of its frightening shriek! It goes up and down a bit better than forward:
